show_scanlogs:false
# With scan_only, take_action has no effect or any cascaded options.  It is very basic scan data.
scan_only:true
# if take_action is true, then the below del_ and ren_ settings have no meaning.
# take_action:false is logging only mode, if you want to see what things will look like if you went for real.
# Any questions on what will happen as a result of your settings, run logging mode and look at the log file.
take_action:false
# Do you want to delete duplicate files the script found?
