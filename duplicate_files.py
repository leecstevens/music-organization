    May this be useful to you as well as a good learning tool for you.
    The main code repository if you stole / slash and hacked it is here:

    This code is meant to be quick and dirty, I'm sure there are
    other/better ways of doing things.  We're all IT people and have
    our own set in our ways things.  Suggestions welcomed, but not always
    followed.
